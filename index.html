Hello!

This is my academic webpage. I am a PhD student at the University of Calgary in Canada, supervised by (Prof. Christoph Simon)[https://www.iqst.ca/people/peoplepage.php?id=225].
I hold an MSc from Sharif University of Technology in Iran. 

My research is focused on improving designs and implementations of quantum computing and quantum networks.
